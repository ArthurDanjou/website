## Presentation

Many ask me how I started development, what training did I take and why did I start?
Here is the article that allows you to discover everything.

## Summary

- How did it all begin?
- And the web in all this?
- What training did I follow?
- What am I capable of achieving today?
- How do I see my future in this area?
- Conclusion

## 1. How did it all start?

Being a video game player and very curious, I inquired about how a video game worked.
At that time I was playing Minecraft, so I discovered the existence of development and my first programming language: **Java**.
So I wanted to add my personal touch and my creativity to the community. Therefore, I learned to use this language, the syntax, and all that goes with it.
So I installed my first development environment and started with very small projects.

## 2. And the web in all this?

It was much later that I became aware of the vastness of the web domain. As I got interested in this new field, I learned new programming languages: **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
These languages were much easier to learn because I had a good foundation in programming. I trained as much in `Front` as in` Back` development.
The `Front` results in the interface of the application being visible to a user and the` Back` the part invisible and inaccessible to a user.

## 3. What training did I take?

When I started, I took a course on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com) to learn Java syntax.
In addition, I bought myself a big book, a very big 400-page book called `Programming in Java`. I acquired new functionalities such as the principles of object programming for example.
Today, I mostly learn on my own using the Internet and development discord servers.
Recently, I have been taking training on [Udemy](https://udemy.com) in particular to learn **Go** and **Docker**.
Finally, I also use [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to follow more or less technical tutorials.

## 4. What am I able to achieve today

Currently, I can make entire web applications, both the `Back` and the `Front`. As mobile and office applications are based on the same technologies,
I also know how to develop applications of this type. To see all my skills mastered, please visit my [About](/about) page, in the _Technical Skills_ section.

## 5. How do I see my future in this field?

I am currently asking myself a lot of questions about my future in development and my professional future. So I attend a lot of computer conferences and do a lot of research.
Lately, I learned about an area that I knew only vaguely. It was a great interest that immediately developed in this area because it meets all my expectations, 
and I think I will thrive in this area a lot!

## 6. Conclusion

Now you know everything about my beginning and my journey. I hope I have answered all your questions and that you know how to start your journey!
I am available for all your additional questions!

## Information

In addition, I would like to thank **\_RealAlpha\_** and **Freeze** (and all the others) who answered all my questions and with whom I share a great passion!
I started the web efficiently thanks to Freeze, thanks to you ðŸ˜‰
They are very active on Discord servers and will be able to help you with Java and Web development.
