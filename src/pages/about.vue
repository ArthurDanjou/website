      <GridSlot title="Development">
        Development is the passion that appeared the earliest in my life. I started developing on Minecraft and then I migrated to the broad field of the web.
      </GridSlot>
      <GridSlot title="Mathematics">
        During my studies, I loved mathematics very quickly. That's why today I continue my studies in this fabulous field.
      </GridSlot>
      <GridSlot title="Artificial Intelligence">
        We hear more and more about artificial intelligence with the evolution of our society. So I quickly got interested by doing my own research and I quickly discovered that this field is closely related to mathematics, hence my interest.
      </GridSlot>
      <GridSlot title="Cloud and infrastructure">
        When you're doing development and deploying projects online, you discover and are forced to touch the cloud, infrastructure, and network. It's a totally different field than the others but just as interesting.
      </GridSlot>
      <GridSlot title="Fitness">
        In addition to my studies and programming, I go to the gym every day to relax and stay in shape. Sport allows me to recharge my batteries and move on to other things.
